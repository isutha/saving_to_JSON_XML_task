# Coding task during second semester

Throughout the first half of the semester, we worked on few assignments (in groups).
In one of the tasks we had to extend two classes so that they saved their attributes in XML or JSON representation. The input file is a .csv file.


## Saving XML representation
We had to implement the function `def_get_xml_repr(self) -> etree.Element:` which should return a lxml element.

## Saving JSON representation
Here, the attributes of the Joke class should be saved using a JSON representation. Here, we had to implement the function `_get_json_repr(self) -> Dict:` of the Joke
class, which returns a dictionary containing all attributes.



You will find the .csv file in this repository too, in case you wonder what it looked like.
This repository and the code serve as a little insight into my semester.
